## üöÄ How to Use the New Features

### Starting with the Modern GUI
```python
# Run the modern GUI application
python modern_gui_app.py
```

### Real-Time Data Integration
```python
from real_time_data import RealTimeDataManager

# Initialize with your API key
data_manager = RealTimeDataManager(provider="polygon", api_key="your_api_key")

# Subscribe to real-time data
data_manager.subscribe_to_symbol("AAPL")
data_manager.start_real_time_stream()

# Get latest data
latest_price = data_manager.get_latest_price("AAPL")
```

### Risk Management Analysis
```python
from risk_management import RiskManager, RiskLimits

# Initialize risk manager
risk_limits = RiskLimits(max_portfolio_volatility=0.20, max_drawdown_limit=0.15)
risk_manager = RiskManager(risk_limits)

# Add portfolio returns
risk_manager.update_portfolio_history(portfolio_returns)

# Calculate comprehensive risk metrics
metrics = risk_manager.calculate_portfolio_risk_metrics()

# Generate risk report
report = risk_manager.generate_risk_report(metrics, position_risks, violations)
print(report)
```
