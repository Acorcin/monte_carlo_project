# Monte Carlo Trade Order Simulation - Complete Guide

## üìä Understanding Sequence Risk

This project demonstrates **sequence risk** - the impact that the order of investment returns can have on portfolio outcomes. However, it's important to understand when sequence risk actually occurs.

## üîç Key Insights

### When Sequence Risk DOES NOT Occur
- **Simple compounding returns**: When each return is applied to the full portfolio value
- **Mathematical reason**: Multiplication is commutative (A √ó B √ó C = C √ó B √ó A)
- **Example**: Returns of [+10%, -5%, +3%] always produce the same final result regardless of order

### When Sequence Risk DOES Occur
1. **Retirement withdrawals**: Fixed dollar withdrawals during poor early returns
2. **Fixed position sizing**: Trading fixed dollar amounts rather than percentages
3. **Rebalancing strategies**: Periodic portfolio rebalancing can create path dependency
4. **Leverage and margin**: When position sizes are constrained by available capital

## üöÄ Real-World Data Integration

The simulation fetches real market data from:

- **Stock Market**: SPY, individual stocks via Yahoo Finance
- **Futures Markets**: Micro E-mini Nasdaq-100 (MNQ=F) and other futures
- **Crypto Markets**: Bitcoin, Ethereum (symbol dependent on provider)
- **Custom Data**: CSV files with your own trading results

## üîß Installation & Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the basic simulation
python monte_carlo_trade_simulation.py

# Fetch real market data and run simulation
python real_data_example.py

# Debug and understand the math
python debug_simulation.py
```

## üìà Usage Examples

### 1. Basic Simulation with Hardcoded Returns
```python
from monte_carlo_trade_simulation import random_trade_order_simulation

# Simple returns that demonstrate the mathematical principle
returns = [0.10, -0.05, 0.03, -0.02, 0.08]

results = random_trade_order_simulation(
    returns, 
    num_simulations=1000,
    initial_capital=10000
)

# Note: All simulations will produce identical results
# because multiplication is commutative
```

### 2. Real Market Data
```python
from data_fetcher import fetch_stock_data, calculate_returns_from_ohlcv

# Fetch SPY data
data = fetch_stock_data("SPY", period="1y", interval="1d")
returns = calculate_returns_from_ohlcv(data)

# Run simulation
results = random_trade_order_simulation(returns)
```

### 3. Demonstrating Actual Sequence Risk
To see real sequence risk, you need scenarios where order matters:

```python
# Retirement withdrawal scenario (conceptual)
# Fixed $1000 withdrawals with variable returns
# Early losses + withdrawals = different outcome than
# Early gains + later losses
```

## üéØ Educational Value

This simulation teaches several important concepts:

1. **Mathematical Properties**: Understanding when order matters vs. when it doesn't
2. **Real-world Application**: Recognizing scenarios where sequence risk is relevant
3. **Data Integration**: Working with real financial market data
4. **Risk Analysis**: Quantifying uncertainty in trading outcomes

## üî¨ Technical Details

### Random Shuffling Implementation
```python
# Each simulation uses a different random seed
for i in range(num_simulations):
    rng = np.random.RandomState(42 + i)
    shuffled_returns = trade_returns.copy()
    rng.shuffle(shuffled_returns)
    # ... calculate equity curve
```

### Data Sources
- **Yahoo Finance**: Primary source via yfinance library
- **Historical Data**: Multiple timeframes and intervals
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks when data unavailable

## üìä Expected Results

### For Simple Compounding
- **Standard Deviation**: 0.00 (identical outcomes)
- **Range**: $0.00 spread between min/max
- **Insight**: Demonstrates mathematical properties

### For Real Sequence Risk Scenarios
- **Standard Deviation**: > 0 (varying outcomes)
- **Range**: Significant spread based on order
- **Insight**: Shows practical risk implications

## üéì Learning Outcomes

After using this simulation, you'll understand:

1. **When sequence risk matters** in real-world scenarios
2. **How to fetch and process** real market data
3. **Mathematical properties** of multiplicative returns
4. **Risk quantification** techniques
5. **Monte Carlo methods** for financial analysis

## üìù Notes for Practitioners

- **Backtesting**: Be aware that simple return reordering won't show sequence risk
- **Real Trading**: Consider withdrawal patterns, position sizing, and leverage
- **Risk Management**: Focus on scenarios where order genuinely matters
- **Data Quality**: Ensure clean, representative data for meaningful analysis

This simulation serves as both an educational tool and a foundation for more complex sequence risk analysis in real trading scenarios.
